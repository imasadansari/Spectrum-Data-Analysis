# Spectrum-Data-Analysis
We were given a database containing data from DotEcon’s Spectrum Award Database, on various spectrum allocations done worldwide from 1994 until 2020. For India ' s 3G spectrum data, we analyzed all the features, figured out the important features of a spectrum, and then visualized these features. After analyzing and visualizing these features by relating them, we tried to predict prices for next year.
